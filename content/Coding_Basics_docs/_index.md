Welcome to my tips, tricks and tutorials that will help you navigate neuroimaging techniques and coding relevant to neuro analysis

The aim of this section is to share some basics with you about coding practices that may help navigate the command line interface (CLI). I hope will be of particular use to scientists who are knew to the field of computer science, and are here to use anlytical tools that are availble from the command line, such as FSL or Freesurfer amongst many others.
