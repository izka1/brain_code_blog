## History

The first anatomically correct drawing of the brain was thought to be provided by french anatomist Louis Piere Gratiolette in the mid-19th century. 

## Structure

The surface of the brain is made up of sulci and gyri.

{{< hl >}}Gyrus{{< /hl >}} = ridge on the surface of the cerebral cortex

{{< hl >}}Sulcus{{< /hl >}} = groove or depression in the cerebral cortex

The brain is divided into 4 lobes:
- {{< hl >}}Frontal Lobe{{< /hl >}}
- {{< hl >}}Parietal Lobe{{< /hl >}}
- {{< hl >}}Occipital Lobe{{< /hl >}}
- {{< hl >}}Temporal Lobe{{< /hl >}}

There may be three additional regions that we can divided the brain into:
- {{< hl >}}Limbic Lobe{{< /hl >}}: cingulate gyrus connects to the temporal lobe. This connects to the parahippocampal gyrus, creating the limbic lobe
- {{< hl >}}Insula{{< /hl >}}: the Sylvian fissure has a pocket of CSF. The structure inside this region is known as the insula
- {{< hl >}}Central Lobe{{< /hl >}}: either side of the central sulcus there is the precentral gyrus and the post-central gyrus. This combined region is somtimes refered to as the central lobe
